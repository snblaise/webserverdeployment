# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive, security-hardened CI/CD pipeline using Terraform and GitHub Actions. The system will deploy AWS infrastructure with ALB in public subnets, EC2 instances in private subnets, AWS WAF protection, CloudWatch monitoring, automated patching, security scanning, cost controls, and preview environments. The infrastructure follows security best practices with encrypted storage, IMDSv2, least-privilege access, and policy-as-code validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Secure Network Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a secure VPC with proper subnet isolation, so that my applications are protected from direct internet access while maintaining necessary connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a VPC with 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets across different availability zones
2. WHEN EC2 instances are launched THEN they SHALL be placed in private subnets with no direct internet access
3. WHEN the ALB is deployed THEN it SHALL be placed in public subnets to handle incoming traffic
4. WHEN private instances need internet access THEN they SHALL route through a NAT Gateway
5. WHEN instances need AWS service access THEN they SHALL use VPC endpoints for SSM and EC2 Messages to reduce NAT usage

### Requirement 2: Application Load Balancer and Web Application Firewall

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want traffic to be filtered through AWS WAF before reaching my application, so that malicious requests are blocked at the edge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ALB is deployed THEN it SHALL be configured to listen on HTTP port 80 in public subnets
2. WHEN AWS WAF is configured THEN it SHALL include AWS Managed rule groups for common attack patterns
3. WHEN AWS WAF is configured THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN the WAF Web ACL is created THEN it SHALL be associated with the ALB
5. WHEN traffic flows through the system THEN it SHALL be filtered by WAF before reaching EC2 instances

### Requirement 3: Compute Infrastructure with Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want EC2 instances that are hardened against common security vulnerabilities, so that the attack surface is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EC2 instances are launched THEN they SHALL require IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service version 2)
2. WHEN EBS volumes are created THEN they SHALL be encrypted using AWS KMS
3. WHEN instances are configured THEN they SHALL use IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
4. WHEN security groups are applied THEN ALB SHALL only accept traffic from specified CIDR blocks
5. WHEN security groups are applied THEN EC2 instances SHALL only accept traffic from the ALB security group
6. WHEN instances are launched THEN they SHALL run Amazon Linux 2023 with SSM Agent

### Requirement 4: Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that I can respond quickly to infrastructure issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CloudWatch alarms are configured THEN they SHALL monitor EC2 StatusCheckFailed events
2. WHEN CloudWatch alarms are configured THEN they SHALL monitor EC2 CPU utilization above 80%
3. WHEN CloudWatch alarms are configured THEN they SHALL monitor ALB 5xx error rates
4. WHEN alarms are triggered THEN they SHALL send notifications via SNS
5. WHEN SNS topics are created THEN they SHALL support email subscriptions for alert delivery

### Requirement 5: Automated Patch Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want automated patch management, so that security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSM Patch Manager is configured THEN it SHALL create a patch baseline for Amazon Linux
2. WHEN instances are launched THEN they SHALL be tagged with appropriate patch group identifiers
3. WHEN patch schedules are configured THEN they SHALL run weekly using State Manager Association
4. WHEN patches are applied THEN they SHALL use the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document
5. WHEN patching occurs THEN it SHALL maintain system availability and log results

### Requirement 6: Infrastructure as Code with Remote State

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want infrastructure defined as code with secure state management, so that deployments are reproducible and state is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform is configured THEN it SHALL use remote state stored in S3 with versioning enabled
2. WHEN remote state is configured THEN it SHALL use DynamoDB for state locking
3. WHEN S3 buckets are created THEN they SHALL block public access
4. WHEN Terraform versions are specified THEN they SHALL be pinned to version 1.6 or higher
5. WHEN AWS provider is configured THEN it SHALL be pinned to version 5.x or higher

### Requirement 7: CI/CD Pipeline with Security Scanning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated CI/CD pipeline that validates security and cost before deployment, so that issues are caught early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the pipeline SHALL run terraform fmt, validate, and plan
2. WHEN security scans run THEN they SHALL use Checkov for static analysis
3. WHEN security scans run THEN they SHALL use terraform-compliance for policy validation
4. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the pipeline SHALL fail and block deployment
5. WHEN cost analysis runs THEN it SHALL use Infracost to estimate infrastructure costs
6. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the pipeline SHALL provide warnings in PR comments

### Requirement 8: Preview Environments and Branch-based Deployments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy preview environments for testing changes, so that I can validate functionality before merging to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PR is labeled with "preview" THEN the system SHALL create a separate environment
2. WHEN preview environments are created THEN they SHALL use branch-specific Terraform workspaces
3. WHEN preview deployments complete THEN they SHALL comment the ALB URL in the PR
4. WHEN PRs are closed THEN preview environments SHALL be automatically destroyed
5. WHEN preview environments exist THEN they SHALL be isolated from production resources

### Requirement 9: Production Deployment with Approvals

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want production deployments to require approval, so that changes are reviewed before affecting live systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to main branch THEN it SHALL trigger production deployment
2. WHEN production deployment runs THEN it SHALL require manual approval
3. WHEN AWS access is needed THEN it SHALL use OIDC authentication (no static keys)
4. WHEN production applies THEN it SHALL use the previously generated and approved plan
5. WHEN deployment completes THEN it SHALL output the ALB DNS name and resource IDs

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Operational Procedures

**User Story:** As a team member, I want clear documentation on how to operate the system, so that I can effectively manage and troubleshoot the infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include local development setup instructions
2. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL explain the CI/CD workflow and approval process
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include verification steps for deployed infrastructure
4. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL explain how to simulate and test monitoring alarms
5. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include cleanup and destruction procedures
