## üîß Key Improvements Breakdown

### 1. **Resource Import & State Management**

#### Original Approach
```yaml
# Limited import handling
- name: Import Existing Resources
  run: |
    chmod +x scripts/import-and-refresh.sh
    ./scripts/import-and-refresh.sh
  continue-on-error: true
```

#### Optimized Approach
```yaml
# Comprehensive resource import with safety checks
- name: Import Existing Resources (Production Safety)
  if: steps.determine_env.outputs.environment != 'preview-*'
  env:
    TARGET_ENV: ${{ steps.determine_env.outputs.environment }}
  run: |
    if [ -f "scripts/import-and-refresh-enhanced.sh" ]; then
      chmod +x scripts/import-and-refresh-enhanced.sh
      export TF_VAR_env="$TARGET_ENV"
      export TF_VAR_project_name="${{ github.event.repository.name }}"
      
      if ./scripts/import-and-refresh-enhanced.sh; then
        echo "‚úÖ Resource import completed successfully"
      else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Resource import had issues, but continuing"
      fi
    fi
